# To run:
* add a .env file to the root directory with github (and facebook) credentials
* run _node server.js_
* voil√†!

_Note: As you may notice, this server doesn't use a database and passwords are not hashed. Local users you create are saved in plaintext as a js variable and will be cleared each time the server restarts._
